PRIVACY POLICY – VIVOPRO
Last updated: 14 February 2026

DATA CONTROLLER
The data controller for the VivoPro application (“App”) is the developer of the App, published on Google Play under the name VivoPro (package: com.bclstudio.vivopro).
To exercise your rights or for privacy-related questions you can contact us via the App’s Google Play Store page (“Developer contact”) or the channels indicated on the App listing.

TYPES OF DATA PROCESSED

2.1 Data Stored Only on Your Device (Local Data)
The App stores and processes the following data only on your device, without sending it to our servers:

Reminders (title, description, date/time, category, completion status, favorites)

Custom categories created by you

App settings (theme, language, notifications, alarm sound)

Anonymous or pseudonymised usage statistics for habit-analysis features (e.g. task completion, time patterns, streaks)

This data is not transmitted to us or to third parties, except as stated in the following sections (e.g. user-exported backup, optional services).

2.2 Google Account Data (Sign-in with Google)
If you choose to sign in with Google, we use Google’s authentication services (Firebase Authentication). In that case:

Google provides the App with a user identifier, email address, and display name associated with your Google account.

This data is necessary to identify you securely and, if we implement sync across devices in the future, to associate data with your account.

Processing is carried out by Google as a service provider; Google’s Privacy Policy and Firebase terms apply.

2.3 Usage and Analytics Data (Firebase)
The App may use Firebase (Google) for technical functionality and aggregate analytics on App usage (e.g. crashes, performance, generic events). Such data is processed by Google under its Privacy Policy. We do not use analytics to profile individual users for advertising.

2.4 In-App Purchases (Google Play)
Purchases (subscriptions and one-time purchases) are processed by Google Play. We do not store credit card or payment data. Google provides us only with purchase-related information (e.g. product purchased, subscription status) to enable PRO features. Payment data processing is governed by Google’s privacy practices and Google Play terms.

2.5 Backup and Export (PRO Feature)
The backup export feature generates a file (e.g. JSON) containing your reminders and categories. The file is created on your device and can be shared by you manually (e.g. via email, Google Drive, other apps). We do not receive or retain copies of this file; where it goes depends entirely on how you share it.

PURPOSES AND LEGAL BASIS (GDPR)
Data is processed to:

Provide the App’s features (reminders, notifications, calendar, statistics, themes, backup/export) – performance of contract.

Manage sign-in with Google (if enabled) – consent / performance of contract.

Manage subscriptions and purchases via Google Play – performance of contract.

Improve stability and performance (aggregate analytics) – legitimate interest.

Where required by law, consent may be collected explicitly (e.g. before enabling sign-in with Google or certain features).

DATA RETENTION

Local data on device: remains on the device until you uninstall the App or delete it manually.

Google account data: managed by Google; the identifier and data passed to us are retained for as long as you use the App with the linked account; you can revoke access from your Google account.

Purchase-related data: retained by Google Play; we only use “PRO active/inactive” status for as long as needed to provide the service.

Analytics: aggregate data may be retained according to Firebase/Google policies.

RECIPIENTS AND TRANSFERS
Data may be processed by:

Google (Firebase, Google Play, Google account), including in countries outside the EU/EEA (e.g. USA). Transfers are governed by standard contractual clauses and/or adequacy decisions as set out in Google’s policies.

We do not sell or share your personal data with third parties for marketing purposes.

APP PERMISSIONS (ANDROID)
The App may request permissions for: notifications, exact alarms, boot startup (to reschedule reminders), vibration, and audio playback (ringtones). These are used only for the described functionality (reminders and notifications) and not to collect additional data.

YOUR RIGHTS (GDPR)
Under Regulation (EU) 2016/679 you have the right to:

Access: obtain confirmation that data concerning you is being processed and receive a copy.

Rectification: have inaccurate data corrected.

Erasure: have data erased (subject to legal obligations). You can remove local data by uninstalling the App and revoking access from your Google account.

Restriction: request restriction of processing in certain cases.

Data portability: receive your data in a structured format (the App offers JSON export for local data).

Object: object to processing based on legitimate interest.

Complaint: lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority (e.g. in your country of residence).

To exercise these rights, contact us using the details in the Contact section.

CHILDREN
The App is not directed at children under 13 (or the minimum age in your country). We do not knowingly collect data from children. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that a child has provided us with data, they may contact us to request its deletion.

CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY
We may update this policy to reflect legal changes or changes to our features. Material changes will be communicated via an App update or other appropriate means. The “Last updated” date at the top indicates the latest revision.
